# iiClient

### NOTE: If you have already installed **FoliClient**, you will need to **delete the following files in your .minecraft directory**
- config folder
- mods folder

### If you don't want to delete the folders entirely, you will need to delete these from your config;
- Fancymenu folder
- Windowicons folder
- bg.jpg
- craftpresence.properties
- customwindowtitle-client.toml

### and these from your mods;

- MiniHUD (or delete FPSDisplay from iiClient)
- Inventory HUD+ 
- OK Zoomer
- Smooth Boot

## It is also highly recommended to make a new directory or use MultiMC

## Overview

iiClient is a modpack configured to be useful to the average minecraft player. It includes many mods which provide information and efficiency, as well as a host of backend optimization mods. This pack is in honor of iiEthan (a TG mod), so all mods by default are legal on TG.

**Fabric is required for iiClient**
